[ Old Ideas ]
- Fork systemd and D-Bus to support both desktops and smartphones, minimal unit set
- Provide a simple replacement for NetworkManager, focusing on Wi-Fi, USB, Ethernet and tethering
- Fork PipeWire with the inclusion of audio/video routing
- Have the LiveISO base upon ArchISO
- Use cpio for initramfs to reduce bloat and maintain full control over early boot
- Provide static binaries where possible to reduce library overhead
- Have the ability to run older shared libraries for executables to maintain compatibility
- Include Android Framework Support on the Type-1 Virtualization Solution (wo/ Google) (see similar: https://github.com/BC100Dev/alde)
- Write minimal init scripts before handing off to systemd

[ Current Ideas (Desktop Core, v1) ]
[ ] Get initramfs working.
[ ] Have initramfs pass the execution onto the disk.
[ ] Rewrite the libc, merging glibc and bionic into one thing.
[ ] Get core components working (rewrite BusyBox).
[ ] Get the necessary parts working (Networking, Audio Server, Bluetooth, Graphics Pipeline, CPU drivers (if necessary), USB I/O).
  > in other words, that's the HAL we are talking about.
[ ] Get the Wayland Protocol running under the Graphics Pipeline.
[ ] Get the Desktop Environment running
[ ] Provide compatibility for applications

[ Current Ideas (Mobile Core, stabilized in v5, probably) ]
[ ] Port over the Desktop things to Mobile, effectively taking 6 months or probably more to port, ohgodpleasehelpme-
